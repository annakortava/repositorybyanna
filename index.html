    <h1>The 50 Greatest Album Covers of All Time</h1>
    <h2>according to Billboard magazine</h2>
    <p>Music isn't just about the music. Sure, the sounds are certainly the most essential element, but you can't ignore the role of cover art in making a brilliant album From the fold-out gatefolds of the vinyl era to pull-out liner notes in CD jewel cases to the small icon on a digital player, cover art has changed over the years, but it still defines how we look at a particular album. Photographic portraits, paintings, collages -- all these and more are on Billboard's list of the 50 greatest album covers of all time, reaching back to Elvis Presley's self-titled debut to and going up to present day. </p>
    <h3>1. The Velvet Underground and Nico, 'The Velvet Underground & Nico' (1967)</h3>
    <p>This iconic Andy Warhol banana picture with "peel slowly and see" instructions is a great cover on its own, but the original version actually included a peel-off sticker revealing a flesh-colored banana beneath. A perfect combination of art, music and humor.</p>

    <h3>2. The Beatles, 'Abbey Road' (1969)</h3>
    <p>Does any other album cover on this list stop traffic? It's a testament to the lasting impression of this street-crossing photo that hundreds of fans re-create it every day outside Abbey Road Studios. There's even a webcam live feed of the attraction. Another notable fact: It's the first Beatles cover that doesn't feature the band's name or album title.</p>

    <h3>3. Patti Smith, 'Horses' (1975)</h3>
    <p>Aside from the critical acclaim for Smith's beat poetry-infused lyrics mixed with punk rock, Horses' cover is a visual masterpiece. Photographed by close friend and fellow artist Robert Mapplethorpe, the photo of Smith was considered by critic Camille Paglia as one of the greatest photographs ever taken of a woman. With Smith describing her look as Sinatra-like, all elements combined to create one of the greatest album covers (and rock photographs) ever.</p>

    <h3>4. The Notorious B.I.G., 'Ready to Die' (1994)</h3>
    <p>The innocence of a baby-sized Biggie on the cover of his classic debut Ready to Die vastly contradicted the content contained inside. But that was the point: the album traced his life from beginning to a mournful, foreshadowing end, using the innocence of a child to illustrate how a cruel world imprints on unmolded minds.</p>

    <h3>5. Led Zeppelin, 'Led Zeppelin' (1969)</h3>
    <p>Somehow the image of a burning airship erupting into flames just moments before plummeting to the ground and claiming dozens of lives is the perfect visual introduction to Led Zeppelin's debut masterpiece. Whether you see it as an indication of the explosive music within the sleeve, or a heartless shock tactic capitalizing on a real-life tragedy, this black-and-white rendering of the Hinderburg disaster has become of the most indelible images in hard rock. </p>

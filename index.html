    <h1>The 50 Greatest Album Covers of All Time</h1>
    <h2>1. The Velvet Underground and Nico, 'The Velvet Underground & Nico' (1967)</h2>
    <p>This iconic Andy Warhol banana picture with "peel slowly and see" instructions is a great cover on its own, but the original version actually included a peel-off sticker revealing a flesh-colored banana beneath. A perfect combination of art,Â music and humor.</p>
